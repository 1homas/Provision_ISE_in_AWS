# Provision_ISE_in_AWS Playbook

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:  

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/1homas/Provision_ISE_in_AWS.git
    ```

1. Create your Python environment and install Ansible:  

    ```sh
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pipenv install --python 3.9
    pipenv install ansible 
    pipenv install boto boto3 botocore 
    pipenv install ciscoisesdk 
    pipenv install jmespath
    pipenv shell
    ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.ise --force
    ```

    If you have any problems installing Python or Ansible, see [Installing Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

1. Export your various keys, tokens, and credentials for your shell environment.

    ```bash
    # AWS IAM API Keys
    export AWS_REGION='us-west-1'
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY='AKIAIOSF/EXAMPLE+KEY'
    export AWS_SECRET_KEY='wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfi/EXAMPLE+KEY'
    ```

    ```bash
    # ISE REST API Credentials
    export ISE_REST_USERNAME='admin'
    export ISE_REST_PASSWORD='ISEisC00L'
    export ISE_VERIFY=false
    export ISE_DEBUG=false
    ```

    Alternatively, keep your environment variables in `*.sh` files in a `.env` or similar folder in your home directory. Use `source {filename}` to load the environment variables from the files:

    ```bash
    source ~/.env/aws.sh
    source ~/.env/ise.sh
    ```

1. Review the settings in `vars/main.yaml` and change them to match your desired cloud environment. :
    - `project_name`
    - `domain_name`
    - `aws.region` if your AWS region is not `us-west-1`
    - AWS AMI identifiers 
    - your preferred network CIDR ranges in AWS
    - your instance types sizes for your ISE node(s)
    - your default password(s) or pre-shared keys

1. Edit the `provision.yaml` file and comment/uncomment the respective `ise_deployment_*.yaml` file for the deployment you want to provision.  

> âš  Be careful with the deployment and instance sizes... they may be *very* expensive to run if you are not actively using them!

## Provision

Provision your ISE instance(s) and wait for them to be available:

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory provision.yaml
```


The `provision.yaml` playbook creates the following :

- an AWS virtual private cloud (VPC) :
  - Internet Gateway
  - Public & Private Subnets
  - Public & Private Route Tables
- security group(s) for ISE
- ISE instance(s): software, CPU, RAM, storage, etc.
- DNS entries for each ISE node (assumes you have a domain in AWS)

There are potentially *many* more resources that could be created and applied: VPN gateways, certificates, repository, patches, etc. You are encouraged to provision these based on your requirements.  

You may also check availability with: 

```sh
ansible-playbook -i inventory wait_for_ise.yaml
```

## Deploy

Depending on the ISE deployment size and desired services, there are many more steps involved in making the provisioned *Standalone* ISE nodes above into an ISE deployment :

- Import Certificates
- Primary & Secondary Policy Administration Node (PAN) role election
- Primary & Secondary Monitoring & Troubleshooting (MNT) role election
- Policy Service Node (PSN) role election
  - Services configuration
  - Interfaces configuration
- Node Group creation and PSN assignment

You may add your tasks for these to the `deploy.yaml` playbook and run it :

1. Run the Ansible playbook:  

    ```sh
    ansible-playbook deploy.yaml
    ```

## Destroy

When you are done, you *should* terminate and remove all instances and associated resources to save money and prevent surprise bills from your cloud provider!

```sh
ansible-playbook terminate.yaml
```
